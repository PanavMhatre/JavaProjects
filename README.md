**Overview**


Welcome to my JavaProjects. These are a collections of more easier Java projects that are still hard but not too hard that emulate real life things that are interesting to me. These take user input and output things. These are various things in real life and I hope you enjoy them! They aren't as complex as my other projects which have a UI and rather have the console!

To run each one either go to the link on the top of the file or if cloning jsut run each indivual file to play each game!
